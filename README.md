# **Steps to Run!** üòò

```
* Please test application on real device
* Recommend use iOS device to test application

  1. cd kaew-ta-app
  2. yarn install
  3. yarn start
  4. open Expo Go and scan QR CODE
```

**Expo Go** is an application for testing apps on real devices. Can be downloaded from App Store and Google Play Store.

# **Bug ?** ü•≤üòì

When running the application in android and selecting detection mode, you have to press save 1 time to detect. If you don't press save, it can't be detected. and when returning to the main menu at the terminal will alert

```
WARN  Possible Unhandled Promise Rejection (id: 0):
Error: ExponentGLObjectManager.createCameraTextureAsync: GLContext not found for given context id
```

But in iOS it can be used normally. and load the model faster and work more stable as well.
